Open Source

The code for Pegex-TOML is hosted at GitHub. The URL is:

  https://github.com/ingydotnet/pegex-toml-pm

This project uses the Zilla-Dist framework for development and release
automation. You install it with:

  cpanm -n Zilla::Dist   # -n means "no test" which can save a lot of time

Once installed, run `zild make` to get a list of all the things you can do.
See https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Zilla-Dist/lib/Zilla/Dist.pod for

NOTE: If you just want to run the tests without installing Zilla::Dist, use:

  prove -lv test/
